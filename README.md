# OOP Game-Coroama Larisa


Battleships game implemented by myself for the Oriented Object Programming course at college.

The game is written in C++ and uses the Qt library. You can either play with someone else(1V1) or with the computer.

The computer tries to beat you by using an algorithm in which if it hits any of your pieces, it hits every other block in vicinity until it hits either the rest of the piece or any other piece and then moves to that block. If it doesn't succeed in hitting a piece, it picks a random block in the matrix that hasn't been hit yet and the algorithm restarts. 


If you wish to run this code, you need to change the images and the audio track.
